# UNIX:

• Everything is a file:In UNIX, everything, including devices and directories, is treated as a file.

• Small, single-purpose programs:The UNIX philosophy encourages the creation of small, modular programs that perform a single task well.

• Text-based configuration:Configuration files in UNIX are often text-based, making them human-readable and easily editable.

• Hierarchical File System:The file system is organized as a hierarchy or tree structure, with the root directory ("/") at the top.

• Processes: UNIX treats processes as independent entities, each having its own memory space and resources.

• Pipeline: The use of pipelines (|) allows the output of one command to be used as the input for another.

• Redirection: Output or input from/to a command can be redirected using symbols (>, <, >>).

• Security: UNIX is known for its robust security features, such as file permissions and user authentication.
